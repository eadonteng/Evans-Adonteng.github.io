# Enhanced Farkle Game Project
Welcome to my ePortfolio repository for the Farkle Game Project. This repository contains the original and enhanced versions of the Farkle game, demonstrating my application of advanced programming techniques, database integration, and algorithm optimization to improve the classic dice game.

# Repository Structure
This repository is organized to clearly present the original game code alongside its enhancements in three key areas:

# /original_artifact
farkle_original.cpp - The original version of the Farkle game code.

# /enhanced_artifacts
farkle_enhanced_software_design.cpp - Showcases enhancements in software design and engineering.

farkle_enhanced_databases.cpp - Demonstrates integration with SQLite for managing high scores.

farkle_enhanced_algorithms.cpp - Contains optimizations related to game logic and scoring algorithms.

# /documentation
farkle_enhanced_narratives - Comprehensive documents explaining the journey, rationale behind enhancements, and how these align with specific course outcomes.

# /videos
Code Review Video - A link to a video where I discuss the code enhancements and demonstrate the game (replace "#" with the actual link).

# How to Navigate
Start with /original_artifact: Review farkle_original.cpp to understand the baseline functionality of the game.
Explore /enhanced_artifacts: Examine each enhanced version to see specific improvements and features added in different aspects of the game.
Read /documentation/narrative.md: Gain insights into the technical decisions, implementation details, and how these enhancements align with professional and academic goals.
Watch /videos/Code Review Video: Visualize the enhancements in action and understand the practical applications of the changes made.

# Enhancements Overview
Each enhancement in the Farkle game has been designed to address distinct aspects of game development:

Software Design and Engineering: Focuses on improving the architecture of the game, ensuring better modularity, readability, and maintainability.

Databases: Integrates a lightweight SQLite database to persistently store and retrieve high scores, enhancing the competitive aspect of the game.

Algorithms and Data Structures: Optimizes the scoring and dice rolling algorithms to enhance performance and user experience.

# Viewing and Using the Artifacts
To compile and run any version of the game, ensure you have a C++ compiler and SQLite installed on your system. Detailed instructions for setup and execution are included within each file's comments.
