# Introduction
In this project, I focused on enhancing a console-based Farkle game initially developed during my computer science coursework. The objective was to apply advanced programming concepts, improve the game's performance and user experience, and ensure adherence to professional software development standards.

# Project Enhancements
## Collaborative Development Strategies
Objective and Outcome Alignment: I employed strategies for building collaborative environments to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science. This involved soliciting feedback from diverse audiences, including co-workers and instructors, to gather insights and perspectives on potential enhancements to the Farkle game.
Description and Implementation: Throughout the enhancement process, I actively engaged with peers and mentors, seeking input on proposed design changes and evaluating the feasibility of various implementation approaches. Collaborative brainstorming sessions facilitated the identification of optimal solutions and the alignment of project goals with industry standards and best practices.


# Professional Communication
Objective and Outcome Alignment: I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. Effective communication is essential in conveying complex technical concepts and fostering understanding among diverse stakeholders.
Description and Implementation: I ensured that all project documentation, including code comments, README files, and project reports, adhered to professional communication standards. Clear and concise explanations were provided for each enhancement made to the Farkle game, enabling stakeholders to comprehend the rationale behind design decisions and implementation details.

# Algorithmic Design and Evaluation
Objective and Outcome Alignment: I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. This involved optimizing data structures and algorithms to improve the efficiency and scalability of the Farkle game.
Description and Implementation: I thoroughly analyzed the existing codebase to identify areas for optimization, particularly focusing on the scoring logic and game mechanics. By employing algorithmic principles such as time complexity analysis and optimization techniques, I implemented enhancements that significantly improved the game's performance and responsiveness.

# Software Engineering Practices
Objective and Outcome Alignment: I demonstrated the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. This included adhering to software engineering principles, design patterns, and industry standards throughout the development process.
