Version: 3.0

# Artifact Description
 The selected artifact for enhancement is an improved version of a Farkle game implemented in C++, integrated with SQLite database functionality for managing high scores. 

# Justification for Inclusion
This artifact was chosen for inclusion in the ePortfolio due to its demonstration of proficiency in software development, particularly in databases. The integration of SQLite database functionality enriches the user experience by providing persistence of high scores across game sessions. By selecting this item, I aim to showcase my skills and abilities in designing and implementing software solutions that incorporate database management, a crucial aspect of modern software development.

# Specific Components Showcasing Skills
•	Database Initialization: The function initializeDatabase() demonstrates the ability to create and prepare a database for use within the application, ensuring proper setup and functionality.
•	High Score Insertion: The insertHighScore() function showcases proficiency in database interaction by inserting player names and scores into the database after each game, ensuring accurate recording of high scores.
•	High Score Display: The displayHighScores() function exhibits skills in querying and displaying data from the database, providing users with visibility into the top high scores.

# Enhancements Made
The artifact was improved by implementing the planned enhancements identified during the code review process. These enhancements focused on optimizing database operations, refining user feedback, and ensuring robust error handling. Specifically, improvements were made to error handling mechanisms, input validation, and random number generation for enhanced gameplay experience.
Meeting Course Outcomes
