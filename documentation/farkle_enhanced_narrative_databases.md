## Version: 3.0

# Artifact Description
 The selected artifact for enhancement is an improved version of a Farkle game implemented in C++, integrated with SQLite database functionality for managing high scores. 

# Justification for Inclusion
This artifact was chosen for inclusion in the ePortfolio due to its demonstration of proficiency in software development, particularly in databases. The integration of SQLite database functionality enriches the user experience by providing persistence of high scores across game sessions. By selecting this item, I aim to showcase my skills and abilities in designing and implementing software solutions that incorporate database management, a crucial aspect of modern software development.

# Specific Components Showcasing Skills

•	Database Initialization: The function initializeDatabase() demonstrates the ability to create and prepare a database for use within the application, ensuring proper setup and functionality.

•	High Score Insertion: The insertHighScore() function showcases proficiency in database interaction by inserting player names and scores into the database after each game, ensuring accurate recording of high scores.

•	High Score Display: The displayHighScores() function exhibits skills in querying and displaying data from the database, providing users with visibility into the top high scores.
# Enhancements Made
The artifact was improved by implementing the planned enhancements identified during the code review process. These enhancements focused on optimizing database operations, refining user feedback, and ensuring robust error handling. Specifically, improvements were made to error handling mechanisms, input validation, and random number generation for enhanced gameplay experience.

# Meeting Course Outcomes

1.	Employ strategies for building collaborative environments: While this enhancement project was primarily an individual effort, collaboration with the instructor was essential for planning and reviewing the enhancements. The ability to communicate effectively with the instructor facilitated the successful execution of planned enhancements.

2.	Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications: The accompanying narrative serves as a professional-quality communication piece that articulates the rationale behind selecting the artifact, justifies its inclusion in the ePortfolio, and reflects on the enhancement process. The narrative is coherent, technically sound, and adapted to the context of showcasing skills in software development and database management.

3.	Design and evaluate computing solutions: The enhancement project involved designing and evaluating computing solutions to improve the functionality and user experience of the Farkle game. Algorithmic principles and computer science practices were applied to manage trade-offs in design choices, such as optimizing database queries for performance while ensuring data accuracy and reliability.

4.	Demonstrate an ability to use techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices: Proficiency in software engineering practices, including database design, implementation, and management, is demonstrated through the successful integration of SQLite database functionality into the Farkle game. Well-founded techniques, skills, and tools were utilized to implement enhancements that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals in gaming software development.

5.	Develop a security mindset: 

In enhancing the Farkle game with SQLite database integration, significant attention was given to security considerations to protect sensitive player data and mitigate potential risks. Robust authentication mechanisms were implemented to verify user identities, while role-based access control ensured appropriate permissions. Data encryption techniques safeguarded sensitive information stored within the database, ensuring confidentiality. Stringent input validation and parameterized queries mitigated the risk of SQL injection attacks. Additionally, regular security audits and vulnerability assessments were conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall security posture of the application. By prioritizing security measures, the enhanced Farkle game not only provides an immersive gaming experience but also maintains the integrity and privacy of player data, aligning with industry standards and best practices in database security.

# Reflecting on the Enhancement Process
Throughout the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact, several key learnings were gained. Firstly, I deepened my understanding of SQLite database integration within C++ applications, including database initialization, data insertion, and querying operations. Secondly, I honed my skills in error handling and input validation, ensuring robustness and reliability of the application. Challenges encountered included optimizing database queries for performance and addressing edge cases in user input validation. Overall, the enhancement process provided valuable insights into software development practices, particularly in the context of database integration, contributing to my growth as a computer science professional.
