Version: 1.0 

# Artifact Overview
The artifact presented herein is an enhanced rendition of the classic Farkle game code. Farkle is a popular dice game where players roll dice to accumulate points, with the ultimate objective of reaching a predetermined winning score. 

# Justification for Inclusion
The decision to include this artifact in my ePortfolio is grounded in its demonstration of advanced skills and abilities in software development, particularly within the domain of software design and engineering. This artifact serves as a testament to proficiency in various aspects of software development, including but not limited to:
•	Modular Design: The code has been structured into modular components, with each function serving a specific purpose. This modular design approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and scalability. By breaking down the code into smaller, cohesive units, it becomes easier to understand and modify, facilitating collaboration among developers.
•	Optimized Scoring Logic: A key enhancement in this version of the Farkle game code lies in the optimization of the scoring logic. Leveraging efficient data structures such as unordered_map, the scoring algorithm has been optimized for performance without compromising accuracy. This optimization contributes to faster execution times, thereby enhancing the overall gaming experience for players.
•	Comprehensive Documentation: Thorough and well-structured documentation accompanies the code, providing insights into its functionality, usage, and internal workings. Each function and component is meticulously documented, elucidating its purpose, input parameters, and expected behavior. This comprehensive documentation not only aids in understanding the code but also serves as a valuable resource for future maintenance and troubleshooting.
•	Input Validation: The code incorporates robust input validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity and consistency of user inputs. By validating user input against predefined criteria, potential errors and inconsistencies are preemptively mitigated, thereby enhancing the reliability and robustness of the game.

# Alignment with Course Outcomes
The enhancements made to the Farkle game code align closely with the overarching objectives of the CS 499 course, particularly in the realm of software design and engineering. These enhancements demonstrate proficiency in the following areas:
•	Collaborative Environments: Throughout the enhancement process, collaboration among team members was fostered through regular communication and feedback exchange. By soliciting input from diverse audiences, decisions regarding design choices and implementation strategies were informed by multiple perspectives, resulting in a more refined and robust solution.
•	Professional-Quality Communications: The narrative accompanying the artifact has been crafted to deliver clear and coherent explanations of the artifact's selection, enhancements made, and the enhancement process. It is tailored to specific audiences, including peers, instructors, and potential employers, and is adapted to the context of an ePortfolio showcasing software development skills.
•	Algorithmic Principles and Computing Solutions: The enhancements made to the Farkle game code reflect a deep understanding of algorithmic principles and computing practices. Design choices regarding data structures and algorithms were carefully evaluated, considering trade-offs in terms of performance, complexity, and scalability. The iterative development process allowed for the refinement and optimization of computing solutions to solve the given problem effectively.
